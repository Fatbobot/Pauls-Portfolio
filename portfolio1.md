Using a combination of .round() and.print() to output a formatted response that uses strings. The purpose here is to ultimately find the standard deviation of a dataset, while simultaneously rounding and outtputting a formatted response


```python
std_rt= np.std(RT).round(2)
print("Standard deviation = " + str(std_rt) + " ms")
____________________________________________________
Standard deviation = 95.21 ms
```
